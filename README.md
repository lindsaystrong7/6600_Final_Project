# DSAN 6600 Final Project: Melanoma Detection 
### Authors: Lindsay Strong and Mandalika Sai Prerana

## Description:

There is a need for artificial intelligence in melanoma detection as dermatologists spend copious amounts of time assessing moles for melanoma. This project compares three pre-trained convolutional neural net models for melanoma detection. The dataset used in this paper comes from the SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification Kaggle Competition in 2020. By training three different models, ResNet, DenseNet, and ResNext, we found that DenseNet is the best performing model. Further use of artificial intelligence in melanoma detection should use the DenseNet algorithm. 

## Setup

You can use this code by cloning this repository.

    git clone https://github.com/lindsaystrong7/6600_Final_Project.git


The required dependencies are included in the requirements.txt file. The command is as follows,

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Additionally the train and test data must be downloaded following this link: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/siim-isic-melanoma-classification/data 

The dataset is not included in this repository is it is too large and must be downloaded to your personal computer.

## Usage

Users can explore the dataset using the EDA and Data Cleaning jupyter notebook in the code folder. Users can run and explore the results of the pre-trained CNN models on teh dataset; ResNet, DenseNet, and ResNext in the code folder as well.
